# Not Applicable

This document is a placeholder. Lua-based GTFS post-processing is specific to transit routing applications (MOTIS) and does not apply to LTEngine, which is a machine translation service.

For LTEngine customization:
- Use `--model-file` to load custom GGUF models
- Modify `src/prompt.rs` to change translation prompt templates
- See `docs/PORTABLE_APP.md` for API extension guidelines
